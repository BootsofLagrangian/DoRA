## DoRA: Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation

Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09353

DoRA decomposes the pre-trained weight into two components, magnitude and direction, for fine-tuning, specifically employing LoRA for directional updates to efficiently minimize the number of trainable parameters. By employing DoRA, we enhance both
the learning capacity and training stability of
LoRA while avoiding any additional inference
overhead. DoRA consistently outperforms LoRA
on fine-tuning LLaMA, LLaVA, and VL-BART
on various downstream tasks, such as commonsense reasoning, visual instruction tuning, and
image/video-text understanding

## ðŸ’¥ News ðŸ’¥
- **[04.18.2024]** ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ We have released source code and the DoRA weight of LLaMA finetuning on commonsense reasoning tasks and LLaVA!
- **[03.20.2024]** ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ DoRA is now fully supported by the HuggingFace PEFT package and can now support Linear, Conv1d, and Conv2d layers, as well as linear layers quantized with bitsandbytes! 


## Quick Start and some tricks regarding finetuing with DoRA
### HuggingFace PEFT
DoRA is now supported by the Huggingface PEFT package. You can install the PEFT package using
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/peft.git -q
```

After PEFT is installed, you can simply set the `use_dora` argument of `LoraConfig()` to `True` for applying DoRA.

An example could be as follows:
```bash
from peft import LoraConfig

# Initialize DoRA configuration
config = (
    use_dora=True, ...
)
```
Please refer to the official [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/en/developer_guides/lora#weight-decomposed-low-rank-adaptation-dora) for more details.

### HuggingFace Diffusers
You can also toy with DoRA on finetuning diffusion models. See [huggingface/diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/advanced_diffusion_training#dora-training). Another good tutorial would be this [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/134mt7bCMKtCYyYzETfEGKXT1J6J50ydT?usp=sharing#scrollTo=23d6bb49-3469-4e23-baf5-25b2344b599d) from [Linoy Tsaban](https://twitter.com/linoy_tsaban).

In general, DoRA finetuning on diffusion model is still _experimental_ and is likely to require different hyperparameter values to perform best compared to LoRA.
> Specifically, people have noticed 2 differences to take into account your training: 
> 1. **LoRA seem to converge faster than DoRA** (so a set of parameters that may lead to overfitting when training a LoRA may be working well for a DoRA)
> 2. **DoRA quality superior to LoRA especially in lower ranks** the difference in quality of DoRA of rank 8 and LoRA of rank 8 appears to be more significant than when training ranks of 32 or 64 for example.

### DoRA hyperparameters settings
> [!NOTE]
> ðŸ’¡ While fine-tuning with DoRA, by utilizing the configuration of LoRA can already achieve better results most of the time, achieving optimal performance compared to LoRA still requires adjustments to the hyperparameters. 

> We suggest starting with a slightly lower learning rate than that of LoRA, and users may also experiment with varying lora dropout ratios.

> User may also start with half of the rank of the LoRA configuration which oftentime can already results in comparable or even superior accuracy compared to that of LoRA.

## Reproducing the results in the paper
